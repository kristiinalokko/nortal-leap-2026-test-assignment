# AI Usage

Briefly describe how you used AI (tools, prompts, code snippets, fixes). Be concise and honest (using AI is fine; it's just a tool; we want to know your method). If you did not use AI, state that here.

1. Could not get project setup running on intellij, needed help with run configurations. I used Claude with different prompts and copied any errors that appeared.

2. In third part, i used Claude on whether to use JPA naming convention to resolve finByLoanedTo() or write the explicit custom query
